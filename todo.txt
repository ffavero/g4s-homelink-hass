- Fix build process. Do I need travis? Tagging is a pita
- Setup a submodule to refer to this repo.
- Actually integrate the code, first get the risco polling working.
- /data/options.json is your actual config json

- how to interface with built in broker - discovery?

docker build -t local/risco-hass-bridge .
